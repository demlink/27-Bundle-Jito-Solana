## FOR A PERSON TO APE SOMEONES CODE AND SHARE IT ON GITHUB FOR FREE, NOW UNDERSTAND THE SAME
NOTE: Create market is meant for spamming so only keep like 0.4 sol in your deployer wallet if you want haha

1. SETUP
    a) Run `npm i`.  

    b) Put your blockengine keypair inside of blockengine.json.  

    c) Edit the config.ts, there is 2 different keypairs in config.ts.  One is for paying all the sol distribution fees 
    and one is for creating the pool (so they have no ties whatsoever).  You can make it the same keypair if you want haha

2. SCRIPT FUNCTIONS

    NOTICE: Start by going sequential order through all steps.

    A) Create keypairs (1).  Don't need to do it for every launch, just when you want but ensure there no SOL in them. 

    B) Premarket (2).  DO ALL STEPS 2-6 IN ORDER!!!!  After each step check the Bundle ID to make sure it lands.  It the bundle
    doesn't land simply redo that step with a higher tip!  Then exit.  Check here: https://explorer.jito.wtf/

    C) CREATE POOL (3).  To create a pool just spam the function because sometimes it doesnt land.  Either increase the tip or SPAMMMMMMM. 
       I recommend tip of 0.1 SOL or more to land within the first few tries.

    D) SELL FEATURES (4/5).  Since pool is now live you can either SELL ALL keypairs at once using (4) and reclaim the WSOL in step 7 of 
    Premarket (2) after you rug.  YOU CAN ALSO sell small %ages of the supply before hand on demand (5).  It does this by sending 
    (input)% of every keypairs token balance to the fee payers then sells it all in 1 singular bundle AND only on 1 wallet :)))) kinda advanced haha.

    E) LP REMOVE (6).  If you dont burn your LP it simply removes it hehe :)
